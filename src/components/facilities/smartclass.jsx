Smart classrooms are very beneficial for better learning and teaching. Teaching faculties can have quick access to the numerous resources available on internet for thorough understanding of students. In todayâ€™s digital world students are curious to know everything and want to gain extra knowledge about the ongoing topic in the class. It is a limitation of a book that it contains only the syllabus. If any student wants knowledge beyond syllabus, internet can be a very useful way for this. The audio visual technology present in the classroom can make the process of learning interesting and enjoyable. It may also act as an efficient and productive method of teaching - learning. Animations and videos can be shown to the students for thorough learning.
